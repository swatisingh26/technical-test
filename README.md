# technical-test
A basic level technical test for applicants for a QA position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technical test has one goal and one rule:

THE GOAL:
- Make all the unit tests in the 'TechnicalTestUnitTests' project pass

THE RULE:
- Achieve the goal by ONLY modifying (the code in) the 'TechnicalTestCore' project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE BEAR IN MIND:
- We are aware that the technical skill of QA professionals varies greatly. The 
test will be trivial for some and hard for others. As such not being able to
complete the entire test doesn't mean your application won't be considered. We'd
just like to see how far you did get.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNICAL INFO:
- Programming language: C#
- Unit testing framework: xUnit
- Non-standard C# library used: FluentAssertions

1.1 Install Git to your local system
1.2 Go to https://github.com and sign in (create an account if you don't have one)
1.3 Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/technical-test
1.4 Click 'Fork'
1.5 Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
1.6 Use the provided .git URL to clone the repository to your local system with
    the installed Git client
2. Or download
2.1 Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/technical-test
2.2 Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
2.3 Click on the 'Download ZIP' button to download a copy of the solution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE TECHNICAL TEST
1. Install Visual Studio to your local system
2. Open the TechnicalTest.sln file with Visual Studio

HANDING IN THE TEST RESULTS:
There are two ways to hand in the exercise:
1. Either commit your solution to a branch on your GitHub Fork (strongly 
   preferred):
1.1 Commit your solution to the test to your local Git repository
1.2 Push your commit upstream to your GitHub fork
1.3 Send an email with a link to the branch of your GitHub fork containing your 
    work to your contact at the office
2. Or make a .zip or .7z of your solution and email it to your contact at the
